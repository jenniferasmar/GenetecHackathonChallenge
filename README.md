# Genetec Challenge 2021

The Genetec Challenge is a hackathon spread across 5 days and the main challenge revolved around solving 5 daily objectives to process a continuous stream of incoming license plates in order to generate the most money for properly and efficiently validating the wanted license plates. We finished the challenge in top 3 among 37 teams.

## Tech Stack

Our tech stack consisted of Java and the project was managed using Maven in order to import and utilize the required Microsoft Azure Libraries to complete the daily objectives, which includes Azure Service Bus, Azure Storage, and Azure Cognitive Services. This project will not run unless you have the authorized credentials and endpoints provided by Genetec during the challenge.
